Image::XFace

This is a very simple interface to the libcompface library used for encoding
and decoding `X-Face' images used in email headers.

Many versions of libcompface are broken and don't contain the compface
function. This is fine if you don't want to create X-Face data, less so
otherwise. I fixed this in faces-1.6.1 with the following patch:

The interface code was written by SWIG, because I am too lazy to write XS
code myself. However, I have modified the results of the SWIG stuff, so you
can't simply re-run it from the interface definition in swig/. In particular,
the version of SWIG I used didn't like to make modules in subdirectories and
I couldn't see a nice way to combine perl and C code in the generated pm file.
So I just cobbled it together manually.
